Swarm_Center application
- enables a single operator to control a team of drones thru a graphical user interface (ui)

- provides command + control and situational awareness of drones
- movement and strike tasks can assigned to one or multiple drones with multiple targets

Future work:
- integrating real robots
- additional mission profiles
- note that same software that works on sim also works in real life robots

conclusion:
- Overall, single operator control of drone swarms would grant the Canadian soldier scalable, precise and agile ISR and strike capabilities.
